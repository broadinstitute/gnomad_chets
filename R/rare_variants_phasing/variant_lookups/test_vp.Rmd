# Variant pair found in at least a sample
This variant pair is found in a single individual of EAS ancestry.
Both variants in the pair are only found in EAS, thus only EAS is shown here.

`r vp_found_tables`

# Variant pair not found in any samples
Each variant is found in individual samples but no sample carries both. For these, only showing the numbers for all samples for now -- probably would be good to also show populations breakdown.

`r vp_not_found_tables`
